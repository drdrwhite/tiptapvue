# TipTap Vue.js Node View Dynamic Tag Problem Example

25/10/2022

This repo is a minimal example of TipTap that illustrates a problem with Vue.js node views.

Run the example locally (see below) and then type some text in the editor. Change the paragraph to a heading, then
toggle the heading level using Command-Alt-1, 2, 3 to change the heading level. Whilst the underlying json in the
document content correctly contains the text, it does not render correctly in the DOM.
